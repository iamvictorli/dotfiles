## Terminal

- [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) as my shell, which some custom plugins. plugin includes [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

- Neovim on [0.8.2](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.8.2)

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) with [tmux.conf](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), simple terminal UI for git commands, requires git to be installed first

- [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker), the lazyier way to manage docker, requires docker to be installed first
